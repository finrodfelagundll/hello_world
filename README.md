# hello_world
Github guide

Just following steps from tutorial "hello-world" on github for creating a repository, I fell so depresed because of it, for good sake this is a public document filled with notthing...
Well, almost notthing...
Let's fill it up a bit with few jokes...

First joke: This one is in form of a question
"Why does the dog lick his own balls?"
"Because he can..."

Second joke:
A boy and a girl are sitting under the stars talking...
The boy says to a girl:
"Do you want me to show you the big bear?"
And the girl replies with:
"Shut up you f**l, someon might pass by and see us"

Ok, and a third joke...
"Why am I writing this nonsense?"
The anwser is the same as in the first joke...

Oh, no, sorry... I just saw the "write a bit about yourself" topic in turtorial....
Oh, cr**...
About me:
..average height, average weight, below average in everything else (eg. telling jokes)
I could try to justify my belowaveragnes (I belive I just invented a new word, and yes, I'm aware that that is a trait of very small children) but what's the point in that... my true colours will show with time
Why am I here then?
My first thought was that I'll be using some open source software and this is the place to go for groceries...
I am still far away from that... 
I'm here to learn and with time there should be some kind of benefit from me...
I hope
You shouldn't allow people like me to write whatever crosses their minds...
